title: IEEE 802.15.4 Sniffer for OpenMote-CC2538

For my first research intership that is part of my Masters in Computer Science study I wrote a sniffer for IEEE 802.15.4 networks which is written to run on the [OpenMote-CC2538](http://www.openmote.com/shop/openmote-cc2538.html) hardware.

Features:

- The sniffer is **lossless**, all packets are captured
- The captured packets can be monitored **real-time** in Wireshark (or can be written to a pcap file)
- The sniffer is **cross-platform**, it will work on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
- You can either show the FCS or replace it with the RSSI, LQI and an FCS Valid bit
- CRC checks and retransmissions are used on the serial connection to avoid possible corruption between the peripheral and host

For more information, check the README in the [github repository](https://github.com/texus/OpenMote-cc2538-802.15.4-Sniffer).
