      <p>My name is Bruno Van de Velde and I'm a 20 year old dude from Belgium. I am currently studying computer science at the university of antwerp. I am interesting in almost anything related with computers and you can find me sitting behind my laptop most of the day.</p>
      <p>I mostly program in C++, but I have done small projects in different language including Python, Java and C#. But I have also needed other languages like Haskell, Prolog, MATLAB and PHP for minor university assignments. This site was completely written by me, so I can work a bit with HTML and CSS too.</p>
